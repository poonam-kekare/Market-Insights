  <h1><b>Geofoam Market Introduction</b></h1>
  <p>Geofoam is a lightweight, engineered foam material used primarily as a geotechnical fill in construction and infrastructure projects. Typically made from expanded polystyrene (EPS) or extruded polystyrene (XPS), geofoam offers a low-density alternative to traditional fill materials like soil or gravel. With its unique properties such as high compressive strength, low thermal conductivity, and ease of installation, geofoam is utilized in road embankments, bridge abutments, retaining walls, and slope stabilization. The demand for geofoam is increasing due to the rising need for cost-effective, space-efficient, and durable construction materials in both developed and developing regions.</p>

  <h1><b>Geofoam Market Overview</b></h1>
  <p>The global geofoam market has witnessed steady growth in recent years and is expected to continue expanding at a significant rate. This growth is driven by increasing infrastructure development, particularly in urban areas, as well as the materialâ€™s suitability for use in challenging construction environments. According to recent market estimates, the geofoam market is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 6% during the forecast period. The market encompasses a range of applications across civil engineering, including road and highway construction, airport runways, railway embankments, and foundation repairs. North America currently dominates the market due to widespread adoption of modern construction materials, followed by Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
